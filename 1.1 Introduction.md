## Artificial Intelligence  
**Artificial Intelligence (AI)** refers to the simulation of **human intelligence** in machines that are programmed to *think* and *act* like humans.  

It involves the development of **algorithms** and **computer programs** that can perform tasks which typically require human intelligence, such as:  
- Visual perception  
- Speech recognition  
- Decision-making  
- Language translation
