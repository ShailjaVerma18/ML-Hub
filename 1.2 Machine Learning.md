# Machine Learning (ML)

## Introduction
Machine Learning is a field of Artificial Intelligence that allows machines to **learn and improve from experiences**.  
It uses algorithms to:
- Analyze data  
- Identify patterns  
- Make decisions  

ðŸ“Œ **Arthur Samuel** first used the term *"Machine Learning"* in **1959**.

- ML makes computers learn from studying **data** and **statistics**.  
- It is considered a **step into the direction of Artificial Intelligence**.

## How Does Machine Learning Work?

1. **Collect Data**  
   Transform raw data into clean datasets.  

2. **Prepare Data**  
   Combine data together and randomize the order.  

3. **Select a Model**  
   Choose a model to train.  

4. **Train the Model**  
   Fit the model to the data.  

5. **Evaluate the Model**  
   Compare predicted outputs to actual target values.  

6. **Tune the Model**  
   If the model does not produce the expected output, retrain and adjust.  

7. **Make Predictions**  
   Use the trained model to predict responses for new data.

## Features of Machine Learning

1. Uses data to detect various patterns in a dataset.  
2. Learns from past data and improves automatically.  
3. Similar to **data mining**, as it deals with large amounts of data.  
4. Models can **continuously learn and adapt** to new data, improving performance over time.
