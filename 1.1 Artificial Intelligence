# Artificial Intelligence (AI)

## Types of AI

AI can be classified in two main ways:
1. **Based on Capabilities**
2. **Based on Functionalities**

---

### 1. Types of AI Based on Capabilities
- **Narrow AI (Weak AI)**  
  Focused on performing a single task efficiently. Example: Siri, Google Assistant.  

- **General AI (True Intelligence)**  
  AI that can perform any intellectual task like a human.  

- **Super AI**  
  AI that surpasses human intelligence and can perform tasks better than humans.  

---

### 2. Types of AI Based on Functionalities
- **Reactive Machines**  
  Only respond to specific inputs, no memory. Example: IBM Deep Blue.  

- **Limited Memory**  
  Can use past data to make decisions. Example: Self-driving cars.  

- **Theory of Mind**  
  AI that understands emotions, beliefs, and can interact socially.  

- **Self-Aware AI**  
  Future AI that has consciousness and self-awareness.

## Hierarchy of Artificial Intelligence

1. **Artificial Intelligence**  
   The theory and methods to build machines that think and act like humans.  

2. **Machine Learning (ML)**  
   The ability for computers to learn from experiences or data without explicit programming.  

3. **Deep Learning (DL)**  
   Mimics the human brain using artificial neural networks (e.g., Transformers) to perform complex tasks.  

4. **Generative AI**  
   Generates new text, audio, images, videos, or code-based content.
